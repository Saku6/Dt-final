Sure, let's include the answers to the VIVA VOICE QUESTIONS:

#### VIVA VOICE QUESTIONS:
1. **What are the most commonly used sensors in IoT?**
   - The most commonly used sensors in IoT applications include temperature sensors, humidity sensors, motion sensors, proximity sensors, pressure sensors, and light sensors. These sensors are essential for collecting data from the environment and enabling IoT devices to respond accordingly.

2. **How did you measure the voltage using sensors?**
   - Voltage measurement using sensors typically involves connecting the sensor to an analog input pin of the microcontroller, such as Arduino. The voltage measured by the sensor is converted into a digital value using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) built into the microcontroller. The microcontroller then processes this digital value to obtain the voltage reading.

3. **What is the purpose of Airflow sensors?**
   - Airflow sensors are used to measure the flow rate or velocity of air in a particular environment. They are commonly used in HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems, automotive applications, and industrial automation. Airflow sensors help monitor and control air circulation, ensuring optimal performance and energy efficiency in various systems.

These answers provide a brief explanation of each question based on the context of the experiment. Let me know if you need further clarification!

Certainly! Here's the procedure for the experiment:

### Procedure:

1. **Setup Hardware Connections:**
   - Connect the BMP280 sensor to the ESP32 microcontroller.
   - Connect the SDA pin of BMP280 to pin 21 (BMP_SDA) of ESP32.
   - Connect the SCL pin of BMP280 to pin 22 (BMP_SCL) of ESP32.

2. **Initialize Ubidots and BMP280:**
   - Initialize the Ubidots client with your Ubidots token.
   - Initialize the BMP280 sensor with its I2C address (0x76).
   - Check if the BMP280 sensor is properly connected. If not, display a message indicating the failure.

3. **Connect to Wi-Fi:**
   - Print a message indicating the initialization of Wi-Fi connection.
   - Establish a Wi-Fi connection using the provided SSID and password.
   - Display a message indicating successful Wi-Fi connection.

4. **Initialize Ubidots Connection:**
   - Set the broker for the Ubidots client to "things.ubidots.com".
   - Enable debug mode for the Ubidots client.
   - Begin the Ubidots client and set up a callback function for handling incoming messages.
   - Display a message indicating successful initialization of the Ubidots connection.

5. **Main Loop:**
   - Continuously loop through the following steps:
     - Read temperature, pressure, altitude, and water boiling point data from the BMP280 sensor.
     - Print the acquired data to the serial monitor.
     - Check if the client is connected to the Ubidots server. If not, reconnect.
     - Add the acquired data to the Ubidots client for publishing.
     - Publish the data to the Ubidots cloud platform with the device label "weather-monitoring-system".
     - Loop through the Ubidots client to handle incoming messages.
     - Delay for 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) before the next iteration.

6. **Observation:**
   - Observe the temperature, pressure, altitude, and water boiling point readings displayed on the serial monitor.
   - Verify that the data is successfully published to the Ubidots cloud platform.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Conclude the experiment by summarizing the successful implementation of the Cloud-based weather monitoring system using the IoT platform and relevant sensors.

This procedure outlines the steps to set up the hardware connections, initialize the necessary components, establish Wi-Fi and Ubidots connections, and continuously read sensor data and publish it to the cloud platform. Let me know if you need further clarification on any step!
