**Understanding Robotics Development Platform Environment**

**AIM:** Understanding robotics development platform environment to model, program, and simulate robots.

**TOOLS USED:** Coppeliasim.

**STEPS TO START WITH COPPELIASIM:**

1. **Install Coppeliasim**: Begin by downloading and installing Coppeliasim from the official website onto your computer.

2. **Launch Coppeliasim**: Once installed, launch the Coppeliasim application from your computer.

3. **Create or Load Scene**: You can start by creating a new scene from scratch or loading an existing scene if available. Scenes in Coppeliasim serve as the environment where you will model, program, and simulate robots.

4. **Model Robots**: Use the built-in tools and functionalities in Coppeliasim to model your robots within the scene. You can design and customize the appearance and functionality of the robots according to your requirements.

5. **Program Robots**: Coppeliasim provides scripting capabilities using Lua or Python languages to program the behavior and control of the robots. Write scripts to define the actions, movements, and interactions of the robots within the simulated environment.

6. **Simulate Robots**: Once the robots are modeled and programmed, you can simulate their behavior within the scene. Run the simulation to observe how the robots interact with each other and the environment based on the programmed logic.

7. **Debug and Refine**: Debug any issues or errors encountered during the simulation process. Refine the robot models and programming as needed to achieve the desired behavior and performance.

8. **Save and Export**: After satisfactory simulation and testing, save your work within Coppeliasim. You can also export the simulation results or data for further analysis or integration with other applications if required.

**VIVA VOICE QUESTIONS:**

1. **Definition of Robotics**: What do you understand by the term "robotics," and how would you define it?
   
2. **Laws of Robotics**: Can you list and explain the Laws of Robotics proposed by Isaac Asimov?
   
3. **Applications of Robotics**: Provide examples of areas where robotics can be applied and discuss their significance in those domains.
   
4. **Humanoid Robot**: Describe what is meant by a "humanoid robot" and discuss its potential applications and challenges.
