Sure, I'll integrate the experiment number and name into the structure:

### Experiment No 1
**Experiment Name:** Introduction to open-source IoT Platform and basic interfacing Hands-on.

#### Aim:
Introduction to open-source IoT Platform and basic interfacing Hands-on.

#### Apparatus Used:
- ESP32
- LED
- Resistor
- Breadboard
- Arduino

#### Theory:
The experiment focuses on utilizing an open-source IoT platform, particularly the ESP32 microcontroller, to demonstrate basic interfacing with peripheral components such as LEDs. It involves setting up a Wi-Fi connection, initializing the necessary variables and hardware components, and establishing serial communication for debugging and monitoring purposes.

#### Procedure:
1. Include the WiFi.h library to enable network connection.
2. Define the pin for the LED and Wi-Fi credentials.
3. Set up the void setup() function to initialize variables, communication, and hardware components.
4. Begin serial communication with a baud rate of 9600.
5. Print initialization status to the serial monitor.
6. Configure the LED pin as output.
7. Connect to the specified Wi-Fi network using the provided SSID and password.
8. Continuously check for Wi-Fi connection until successfully connected.
9. Print the local IP address once connected.
10. Enter the void loop() function to execute the main program logic.
11. Turn the LED on and off at intervals with corresponding serial print statements.
12. Repeat the loop indefinitely.

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>

#define LED 2
#define WIFISSID "WiFi Name"
#define PASSWORD "WiFi Password"

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
  Serial.println("Init... T1_Intro");
  Serial.print("\n\nConnecting to");
  Serial.println(WIFISSID);
  WiFi.begin(WIFISSID, PASSWORD);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  Serial.println("WiFi connected.IP address:");
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  Serial.println("HIGH");
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  Serial.println("LOW");
  delay(500);
}
```

#### Precautions:
- Ensure correct wiring and component connections on the breadboard.
- Double-check Wi-Fi credentials to avoid connection issues.
- Handle the ESP32 and peripherals with care to prevent damage.
