#### VIVA VOICE QUESTIONS:
1. **What is signal conditioning?**
   - Signal conditioning refers to the process of manipulating an input signal in order to prepare it for further processing or conversion by a digital system. This may involve amplification, filtering, modulation, demodulation, or other operations to enhance the quality or suitability of the signal for a specific application.

2. **What is the difference between LM34 and LM35 sensors?**
   - The LM34 and LM35 are both analog temperature sensors manufactured by Texas Instruments. The main difference between them lies in their temperature measurement range and output scale. The LM34 measures temperatures in Fahrenheit with a scale factor of 10 mV/°F, while the LM35 measures temperatures in Celsius with a scale factor of 10 mV/°C. Additionally, the LM34 has a temperature range of -50°C to 300°C (-58°F to 572°F), whereas the LM35 has a range of -55°C to 150°C (-67°F to 302°F).

3. **Touch screen of mobile phones uses which type of sensors?**
   - The touchscreens of mobile phones typically use capacitive touch sensors. Capacitive touchscreens detect changes in capacitance caused by the touch of a conductive object, such as a finger. This allows for precise and responsive touch input on the screen.

Certainly! Here's the procedure for conducting the experiment:

### Procedure:

1. **Setting up Hardware Connections:**
   - Connect the ESP32 microcontroller to the relay module.
   - Connect the relay module to the stepper motor.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and properly wired according to the circuit diagram.

2. **Setting up Ubidots Connection:**
   - Open the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on your computer.
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Ensure that the Ubidots library is installed in the Arduino IDE.
   - Replace the placeholders (SSID, Password, Token) in the code with your Wi-Fi credentials and Ubidots token.
   - Upload the code to the ESP32 microcontroller.

3. **Initializing the System:**
   - Power on the ESP32 microcontroller.
   - Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to monitor the initialization process.
   - Check if the ESP32 successfully connects to the Wi-Fi network and Ubidots server.
   - Ensure that the relay module is powered and ready to receive commands.

4. **Executing Voice Commands:**
   - Use a smartphone application developed using MIT App Inventor to send voice commands to the smart home voice assistant.
   - Speak voice commands such as "turn on" or "turn off" followed by the device name (e.g., "bulb") to control the connected devices.
   - Monitor the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to observe the received voice commands and corresponding actions taken by the smart home voice assistant.

5. **Observing the System Response:**
   - Observe the behavior of the stepper motor controlled by the relay module in response to the voice commands.
   - Verify that the relay module switches the connected devices (e.g., bulb) on or off based on the received commands.
   - Note any discrepancies or errors encountered during the operation of the smart home voice assistant system.

6. **Testing the System:**
   - Test the system with various voice commands to ensure its reliability and accuracy in controlling the connected devices.
   - Validate the responsiveness of the system to voice commands and its ability to perform the intended actions consistently.

7. **Recording Observations:**
   - Record the observations, including the performance of the system, any issues encountered, and suggestions for improvement.
   - Note any modifications or optimizations required to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the smart home voice assistant system.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Conclude the experiment by summarizing the key findings, insights gained, and lessons learned from developing and testing the smart home voice assistant system.
   - Discuss the potential applications, advantages, and limitations of such systems in real-world scenarios.

9. **Cleanup:**
   - Power off the ESP32 microcontroller and disconnect it from the power source.
   - Disconnect all hardware components and return them to their respective storage locations.
   - Ensure that the workspace is clean and organized before concluding the experiment.
